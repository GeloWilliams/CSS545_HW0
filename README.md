# Final Project Details


1. Intended Platform:  Android
2. Intended Framework: React Native
3. Cross-Platform?:    Yes
4. Explanation:
   At first impressions, Android seems to be a bit more flexible in terms of customization. With my limited experience, there are certain molds or restrictions in terms of UI development that comes along with iOS. Although my teammates and I are still discussing the details, we are interested in developing a cross-platform app. We tentatively settled on using React native, as one of us has experience with it while I and another teammate are open to learn it in this class. My reason in particular is that I work in Angular for work so I've always wanted to delve deeper into why React has become more popular and how its more functional programming style is different from Angular's more modular style.
